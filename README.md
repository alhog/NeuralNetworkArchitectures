   - Hidden state of the previous time step: H_(t-1) ∈ R^(n × h) (number of hidden units = h).
   - Reset gate R_t ∈ R^(n × h) and update gate Z_t ∈ R^(n × h):
       - R_t = σ(X_t W_xr + H_(t-1) W_hr + b_r)
       - Z_t = σ(X_t W_xz + H_(t-1) W_hz + b_z)
   - Candidate hidden state H~_t ∈ R^(n × h):
